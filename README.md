# CareComms
CareComms is a portal for daycare services. It allows parents and providers to add their children/services to the portal. Parents may enroll their children in public daycare services. Through CareComms, parents/providers can send and receive messages to each other, display relevant child health information to providers, address questions and concerns, send and view status updates, and more.

Uses Firebase development platform for real-time database (hosted on the cloud and synced locally), image storage, and authentication. MongoDB is also used to store children data to allow simple integration with outside data.
